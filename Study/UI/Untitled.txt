React is a front end and open-source JS library used for developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page.
Features of React are 
->Supports server side rendering
->It will make use of the virtual DOM as real DOM manipulations are expensive
->Unidirectional Databindning or data flow
->It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view

Advantages of Using React : 
->Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency : React uses Virtual DOM to render the view. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser.
->Gentle Learning curve
->SEO friendly
->Reusable components

Limitations of React->
->it is not a fully blown framework as it is only a library
->the components of React are many and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all
->it might be difficult for beginners to understand React
->Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX
